I have features developed in parallel worktrees that I need to integrate: $ARGUMENTS

Please help me integrate these features:
1. Create a new integration branch called "integration/parallel-features"
2. For each feature name provided, merge the branch feature/[feature-name] into the integration branch
3. Resolve any merge conflicts that arise
4. Test that all features work together
5. Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken
6. Once integration is successful, merge to main and clean up branches

I want to integrate these safely before merging to main.
