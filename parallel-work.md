I want to develop features in parallel for my expense tracker app using Git worktrees: $ARGUMENTS

Think about how to divide the work up into separate features unless this has been 
clearly explained already. 

Please help me set up the worktree environment:
1. For each feature mentioned, create a worktree at ../expense-tracker-[feature-name] 
with branch feature/[feature-name]
2. Set up the development environment in each worktree
3. List all worktrees to confirm they were created
4. Explain what each worktree will contain and how they're isolated

I want to be able to work on all features simultaneously without conflicts.
